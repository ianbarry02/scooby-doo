# About This Repository
This reponsitory contains 2 files:
  1) A csv file that I compiled from all of my output files after using FFmpeg to extract median hue values for every   frame of the Scooby-Doo intro sequences I gathered.
  2) The Python code I used to generate an interactive graph from that csv file.

I did this project to have fun while expanding my skills. I used the Programming Historian's "Introduction to Audiovisual Transcoding, Editing, and Color Analysis with FFmpeg" (https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0077) and "Creating Interactive Visualizations with Plotly" (https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0115) tutorials to make this project possible. My code is modified directly from the Dr. Grace Di MÃ©o's code provided in the plotly tutorial.

Listed in the table below are the Scooby-Doo intro sequences featured in the sample for this project.
